# GYSTBudget

The best way to get your shit together is to completely focus in whatever shit you need to get together!

That's why i built GYSTBudget:

Get Your Shit Together Budget - a simple CLI --- for now --- budget manager app to get your shit together in your financial life.

It doesn't integrate to banks or other financial institutions, it doesn't allow you to import expenses from csv, json, ofx or whathever fucking format you want to bring.

Because to get your shit together you fucking need to focus in it!

You should add your budgets and transactions - expenses and incomes - manually, as well (if you want to, but I severely recommend) as transactions' categories and origins.

I'll build a manual with further explanations in the future, but for now, you got the idea and that's all that is needed.
